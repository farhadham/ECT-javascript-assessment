## Project Structure

### Tasks

Solutions for each task are located in the `tasks` folder. Each task has its own subfolder containing the relevant solution files:

- **Code Challenges**: Include TypeScript files with code implementations.
- **Non-Code Tasks**: Documented in a `solution.md` file within the respective task folder. These files may also serve as supplementary documentation for code challenges.

### Unit Tests

Each code challenge includes a set of unit tests, which are located within the same task folder. Tests can be executed using the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```

### Entry Point

To make it easy for reviewers to run and explore the code challenges, an interactive entry point has been created. This allows the reviewer to:

1. Select a specific task to run.
2. Execute the examples associated with the code challenge.

Run the entry point using:

```bash
npm run start
```
